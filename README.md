### Hi everyone, I'm Mehmet Ali KIMICIðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I completed my architecture education in 2019. Even though I love architecture, software has always been one step ahead. Now I'm on my way to becoming a software developer.
ðŸŒ±I can always keep up with learning and working as a team. I'm currently focused on HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. 
ðŸ˜„But it will not be limited to this in the future.
