### <h1 align="center">Hi everyone, I'm Mehmet Ali KIMICIðŸ‘‹</h1><hr>

ðŸ”­ I completed my architecture education in 2019. Even though I love architecture, software has always been one step ahead. Now I'm on my way to becoming a software developer.<br>
ðŸŒ±I can always keep up with learning and working as a team. I'm currently focused on HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. <br>
ðŸ˜„But it will not be limited to this in the future.

<h3>How to reach me ?</h3>
