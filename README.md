### <h1 align="center">Hi everyone, I'm Mehmet Ali KIMICIðŸ‘‹</h1><hr>

ðŸ”­ I completed my architecture education in 2019. Even though I love architecture, software has always been one step ahead.I have been interested in the software field since last year. Now I'm on my way to becoming a software developer.<br>
ðŸ‘¯ I can always keep up with learning and I can work with high motivation individually and especially as a team. I believe in writing clean and structured code to ensure maximum compatibility and performance.<br> 
ðŸŒ± I'm currently focused on HTML, CSS,BOOTSTRAP, SCSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT. <br>
ðŸ˜„ But it will not be limited to this in the future.
